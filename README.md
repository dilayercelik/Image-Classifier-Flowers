# Image-Classifier-Flowers 

This repository contains the files I have submitted for the final project of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree offered by the School of AI, Udacity.


# Main Outline 

Part 1 - Image Classifier Project Jupyter Notebook

Part 2 - pair of Python scripts: train.py and predict.py


# Description of the project

> Part 1 of the project aimed to implement an image classifier with PyTorch, using a pre-trained neural network 'VGG-19'. 
> Part 2 consisted of converting the code into the associated command line application.


# Description

Image Classifier Project.ipynb -> Jupyter Notebook
Image Classifier Project.html -> HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook above.
train.py -> python script to train a neural network on flowers dataset of images.
predict.py -> python script to predict flower name from input image.
cat_to_name.json -> JSON file storing a dictionary of numeric indices (keys) and image categories (values - flowers' names)

To access the data: download it [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/flower_data.tar.gz)
The data is made of the main 'flowers' directory, containing 3 subdirectories: train, valid, test.
